## Web Application Development course at Uppsala University

This course covers a set of techniques for developing web applications: HTML and CSS for designing web pages, JavaScript to give web pages useful functions and a good user experience, and connection to databases to manage information and media content.

Furthermore, it teaches to apply criteria and tools to evaluate the usability and accessibility of web pages.

**Course Outline:**

**Lab 1** (Uppgift 1) covers `HTML`

**Lab 2 ** (Uppgift 2) covers `CSS`

**Lab 3** (Uppgift 3) covers `Javascript`

**Lab 4** (Uppgift 4) covers `W3 Standards` and `Accessability`

**Project** (Projekt) is a mix of all the previous labs I got a functionality-specification, some images and text and was supposed to create a website based on that.
