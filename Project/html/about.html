          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Grocery Guru was founded in 2021 by a group of food enthusiasts who
            wanted to make grocery shopping easier for everyone. We noticed that
            many people struggle with meal planning and grocery shopping, so we
            decided to create a platform that would help them save time, money,
            and effort.
