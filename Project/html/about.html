        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Grocery Guru was founded in 2021 by a group of food enthusiasts who
          wanted to make grocery shopping easier for everyone. We noticed that
          many people struggle with meal planning and grocery shopping, so we
          decided to create a platform that would help them save time, money,
          and effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to provide you with the best grocery shopping experience
          possible. We believe that by using our platform, you can become a
          grocery guru too!
